# Weibull Time To Event prediction with PyTorch and deep learning

This is a PyTorch port of Egil Martinsson's machine learning framework for time to event prediction. In brief, this uses a recurrent neural network to estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution conditionally modeling the time until a process's next event.
